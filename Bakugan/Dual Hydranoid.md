This Bakugan is extremely strong, and it steals energy from 8akugan sent to the Doom Dimension to become stronger. Only a cruel and heartless creature coutd do that! In battle, Hydranoid is hard to defeat, thanks to its tough outer skin and double heads. It lashes out at opponents with its long tail. Hydranoid may not be able to move fast. but it makes up for its lack of speed with the sheer force of its attacks.
